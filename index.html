    <div>A croissant is a buttery, flaky, Austrian viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl
        but
        using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent
        shape,
        the
        dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet,
        in a
        technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
